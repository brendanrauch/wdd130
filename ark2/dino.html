                        <h1>Stegosaurus</h1>
                        <p>Stegosaurus regium has approximately 16 paired rows of plates along its back, flanked by another, smaller pair of 6 plates. This is contrary to the alternating rows on Stegosaurus fossils I've seen in museums. Not surprisingly, Stegosaurus uses the spines on its tail to defend itself. While not aggressive, Stegosaurus will come to the aid of another nearby Stegosaurus. This implies it to be a herd animal.</p>

                        <p>Towering over other creatures of the Island and Abberation, Brachiosaurus is a sight to behold. Being a mostly docile herbivore, Brachiosaurus can become very defensive when threatened. With a thick scaly hide and its massive size, few creatures can defeat this behemoth. Brachiosaurus have been observed to briefly take a bipedal stance, rising up on its hind legs in an act of defense. From there, they use all of their body weight to unleash a catastrophic stomp on their attackers. In the unlikely possibility that a Brachiosaurus is in mortal danger, they will let out a magnificent bellow, which seems to frighten even the most powerful predators.</p>

                        <p>Unlike many of the herd animals on the Island, Ankylosaurus crassacutis tends to live in small family units. I believe they can afford to stick with smaller groups because of their incredibly thick skin, for which they're named. Despite not being among the largest of the Island's herbivores, Ankylosaurus is one of the more difficult creatures to take down. Its thick, armored skin seems to make it more than a match for several of the mid-sized predators that would otherwise hunt it. Reckless carnivores are just as likely to hurt themselves on Ankylosaurus' spikes, as they are to get hit by its tail.</p>

                        <h1>Carnotaurus</h1>
                        <p>Carnotaurus pressor is a distinctive creature that falls between a medium and large predator. It lives primarily on flat, clear ground, where it can capitalize on its speed. Additionally, it seems to have no qualms about running away from larger predators instead of fighting. The horns of the Carnotaurus seem to be used more for fighting rivals than actual hunting. This doesn't mean the horns aren't dangerous, though. They can still eviscerate larger prey. Carnotaurus is one of the smaller and more compact of the large predators. If Tyrannosaurus is the “lion” of the Island, Carnotaurus would certainly be the “cheetah.” The real threat of a Carnotaurus is not being able to escape it once it has spotted you.</p>

And to top it off, Araneomorphus is larger than an adult human! If that wasn't enough, I'm convinced that some of the caves on the island have actually been dug by Araneomorphus, but this worries me. Either Araneomorphus is a colony-spider (like ants), or there is a much larger Araneomorphus somewhere on the island.</p>
